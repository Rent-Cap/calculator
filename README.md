# Rent Cap

This project is an effort to help Californians figure out whether the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 will protect them from excessive rent increases.

Most renters will be affected, but our goal is to help them answer that question using publically available data based on their address.

## Contributing

This project was started during the 2019 National Day of Civic Hacking through the [Code for SF](https://codeforsanfrancisco.org/) brigade by [kylpeacock@gmail.com](mailto:kylpeacock@gmail.com).

Our project is open-source and under active development, so please get in touch with us and contribute! We have all kinds of ways to contribute, from Copywriting to UX, as well as Front and Back-end development.

## Development

Ported from codepen https://codepen.io/reidjs/full/oNNaPaj. Styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/)

## Adding copy and using the translator object

Modify the objects in `en.json` and `es.json`.

This project uses [i18next react](https://react.i18next.com/) initialized as a Provider. Use the translator function `t()` to wrap text and read in from en.json or es.json.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Install dependencies

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
